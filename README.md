## About
- Journey to become a certified devOps engineer.
- Master the skills of automation, collaboration, and CI/CD pipelines to accelerate software delivery and enhance team productivity effectively.
- Deep dive into the world of continuous integration, deployment, and delivery by mastering tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible   and more with our DevOps and Cloud Computing. 
- DevOps plays a crucial role in increasing operational efficiency through infrastructure management, upgrades, code deployment, and ensuring continuous delivery and maintenance.

## Why To Learn Devops

- **Point 1:** DevOps ensures continuous and integrated software delivery and makes the software development lifecycle more effective and productive.
- **Point 2:** Faster delivery of software features.
- **Point 3:** Rapid deployment, updates and maintenance.
- **Point 4:** Increased stability in operating environments.
- **Point 5:** Optimized resource utilization.

## The various stages of DevOps depend upon automation tools such as

- **Point 1:** Continuous Management (Puppet, Chef, and Ansible)  
- **Point 2:** Continuous Integration(Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo)
- **Point 3:** Continuous Testing (Docker, Tricentis Tosca, etc)
- **Point 4:** Continuous Monitoring (Splunk, Sneu, Nagios, etc)
